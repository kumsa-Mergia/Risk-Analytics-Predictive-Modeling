# Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring the risk and profitability of an insurance portfolio. The project focuses on understanding data quality, uncovering patterns, and generating actionable insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical thinking.

## Project Goals

- Develop a foundational understanding of the insurance portfolio data.
- Assess data quality, identify missing values, and handle outliers.
- Uncover initial patterns in risk and profitability across various dimensions (e.g., Province, VehicleType, Gender, temporal trends).
- Demonstrate strong analytical and visualization skills to present findings

## Environment Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the development environment on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git https://github.com/kumsa-Mergia/Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling.git

cd Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv #python3 for Linux
```

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Mac/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required Python packages as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

After completing these steps, your development environment will be set up and ready to go.
